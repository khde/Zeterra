Statemanager
    -If **states is full make realloc
    -Make states_current smarter not always -1
        -> Maybe struct State *state for current state?

engine_config.h
    -Add Window width and height to config. Should it be int in struct or a macro?

make event_manager who deals with all that
states.h einführen damit alle States global sind beim zufügen oder auf heap???

Add ressource_manager and make him load all stuff in ressources?? -> Google how to implement
